- 🔥 React Fast Refresh (via Babel or SWC)
- ✅ ESLint configured with React best practices

---

## 🧩 Available Plugins

You can choose between two official plugins:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) – uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh  
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) – uses **SWC** for Fast Refresh (faster builds)

## 📏 ESLint Configuration

Basic ESLint rules are included for React. To enhance code quality and developer experience in larger projects, especially in production apps, consider the following:

- Use **TypeScript** for type safety
- Enable **type-aware** linting rules

Refer to the [React + TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) and the [`typescript-eslint` guide](https://typescript-eslint.io) for setup instructions.
